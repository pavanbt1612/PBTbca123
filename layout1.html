                The world, also known as Earth, is the third planet from the Sun
                and the only known place in the universe that supports life. It is home to over 8 billion people, thousands of cultures, and a wide variety of ecosystemsâ€”from oceans and forests to deserts and mountains. Earth has seven continents and is covered mostly by water. While rich in natural beauty and resources, the world also faces challenges like climate change, inequality, and conflict. Cooperation and understanding among nations are
                essential for building a peaceful and sustainable future.</b>
